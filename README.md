# Analyzing-Historical-Stock-Revenue-Data-and-Building-a-Dashboard
By analyzing and visualizing the profit data alongside stock prices, the project aims to offer valuable insights into the dynamics between a company's financial performance and its market valuation.

## Project Aim

The aim of this project is to analyze the relationship between a company's profit growth and its stock price, focusing on how these financial dynamics can influence investment decisions. The key points addressed in this project include:

1. Stock Price Determination:
        Stock prices are influenced by several factors, including the number of outstanding shares and projected future profits. A critical factor is the company's current profit and its growth trajectory. Typically, an increase in a company's profit leads to a rise in its stock price. Conversely, if an investor anticipates a decline in profits, they might consider short selling the stock.

2. Short Selling Explained:
        Short selling is a strategy used to profit from a declining stock price. This involves borrowing and selling a stock, then repurchasing it at a lower price to return to the lender. While this method can yield quick profits, it carries significant risk if the stock price increases, potentially leading to substantial losses.

3. Case Studies:
        Tesla: Tesla was heavily targeted by short sellers a few years ago. As Tesla's profits increased, its stock price rose, resulting in losses for short sellers. This rise was driven by the company's performance, indicating a sustainable increase in stock price.
        GameStop: In a contrasting scenario, individual investors from the Reddit community WallStreetBets caused GameStop's stock price to soar, despite the company losing money. This surge was driven by speculative buying rather than fundamental performance, making it less sustainable and resulting in significant losses for hedge funds holding short positions.

4. Project Task:
        As a data scientist working for a hedge fund, the objective is to extract profit data for Tesla and GameStop. Using this data, you will build a dashboard to compare the stock prices against the profits of these companies. This will provide insights into how profit growth correlates with stock price movements, supporting informed investment decisions.

The project aims to offer valuable insights into the interplay between a company's financial performance and its market valuation, helping investors understand and anticipate stock price movements based on profit data.
